**Scenario 2**

This repo consists of the implementation of the following scenario: 

**Scenario**
In azure, students must utilize a set of source data (e.g., customer data, transaction data) curated themselves or use data off websites like Github or Kaggle, and load it into Azure Blob Storage. Create a data warehouse in Azure Synapse Analytics and use PolyBase to load data from Azure Blob Storage. Utilize T-SQL scripts to transform the data in the data warehouse (e.g., aggregating, pivoting, and joining data). Finally create a Power BI report that queries the data warehouse and presents it in a meaningful way for stakeholders. The students will be evaluated on their ability to configure, secure, and optimize the Azure blob storage, Azure Synapse Analytics, and PolyBase. Following correct security protocols and best practices.
